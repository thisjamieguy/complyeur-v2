**Namespace**: acp
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-02-16
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-16
**Status**: Active

**Purpose**: Generate a comprehensive project status report including progress, accomplishments, and next steps
**Category**: Documentation
**Frequency**: As Needed

## What This Command Does

This command generates a comprehensive markdown report summarizing the project's current status, progress, accomplishments, and plans. It reads all ACP documentation and creates a formatted report suitable for sharing with stakeholders, team members, or for project records.

Use this command when you need to communicate project status, before milestone reviews, for weekly/monthly updates, or when onboarding new team members. The report provides a complete snapshot of the project at a point in time.

Unlike `@acp.status` which provides a quick console summary, `@acp.report` generates a detailed markdown document that can be saved, shared, or archived.

## Related Commands

- [`@acp.status`](acp.status.md) - Quick console status (not a full report)
- [`@acp.update`](acp.update.md) - Update progress before generating report
- [`@acp.validate`](acp.validate.md) - Validate documentation before reporting
- [`@acp.sync`](acp.sync.md) - Sync docs before generating report

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Report is empty or incomplete

**Symptom**: Generated report missing sections

**Cause**: progress.yaml not up to date or missing data

**Solution**: Run `@acp.update` first to ensure progress.yaml is current, then generate report

### Issue 2: Statistics don't match reality

**Symptom**: Numbers in report seem wrong

**Cause**: Progress tracking out of sync

**Solution**: Review and update progress.yaml manually, verify task counts, then regenerate report

### Issue 3: Report too long or too short

**Symptom**: Report length not appropriate

**Cause**: Too much or too little detail

**Solution**: Adjust report generation to include/exclude sections, customize for audience

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: All files in `agent/` directory, especially `agent/progress.yaml`
- **Writes**: `agent/reports/report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (creates report file)
- **Executes**: None

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Does not access secrets or credentials
- **Credentials**: Does not access credentials files

---

## Notes

- Reports are saved with date in filename for easy tracking
- Reports are markdown for easy sharing and version control
- Generate reports regularly for historical record
- Customize report format for different audiences
- Include reports in project documentation
- Consider automating report generation (weekly/monthly)
- Reports can be converted to PDF or HTML if needed
- Keep reports in version control for history
