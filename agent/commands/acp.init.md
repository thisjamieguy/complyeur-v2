# Command: init

> **🤖 Agent Directive**: If you are reading this file, the command `@acp-init` has been invoked. Follow the steps below to execute this command.

**Namespace**: acp
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-02-16
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-16
**Status**: Active

---

**Purpose**: Initialize agent context by loading all documentation, reviewing source code, and preparing for work
**Category**: Workflow
**Frequency**: Once Per Session

---

## What This Command Does

This command performs a comprehensive initialization of the agent's context for working on an ACP-structured project. It checks for ACP updates, reads all documentation in the `agent/` directory, reviews key source files to understand the current implementation, updates any stale documentation, and refreshes progress tracking.

Use this command at the start of each work session to ensure you have complete project context. It's the most thorough way to get up to speed on a project, understanding both what's documented and what's actually implemented in the code.

Unlike `@acp-status` which only reads progress.yaml, or `@acp-proceed` which focuses on a single task, `@acp-init` provides comprehensive context loading across all project documentation and source code. It's designed to answer: "What is this project? Where does it stand? What needs to be done?"

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project (AGENT.md and agent/ directory exist)
- [ ] Project has source code to review
- [ ] Git repository initialized (optional, for update checking)

---

## Steps

### 1. Check for ACP Updates

Check if newer version of ACP is available.

**Actions**:
- Run `./agent/scripts/check-for-updates.sh` if it exists
- Report if updates are available
- Show what changed via CHANGELOG
- Ask if user wants to update (don't auto-update)

**Expected Outcome**: User informed of ACP version status

### 2. Read All Agent Documentation

Load complete context from the agent/ directory.

**Actions**:
- Read `agent/progress.yaml` for current status
- Read `agent/design/requirements.md` for project goals
- Read all design documents in `agent/design/`
- Read current milestone document
- Read all task documents (focus on current/upcoming)
- Read relevant pattern documents in `agent/patterns/`
- Note any missing or incomplete documentation

**Expected Outcome**: Complete documentation context loaded

### 3. Identify Key Source Files

Determine which source files are most important to review.

**Actions**:
- Check project type (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.)
- Identify main entry points (src/index.ts, main.py, cmd/main.go, etc.)
- Note key configuration files (tsconfig.json, .env.example, etc.)
- Identify core business logic files
- List test files

**Expected Outcome**: Key source files identified for review

### 4. Review Key Source Files

Read important source files to understand current implementation.

**Actions**:
- Read main entry point files
- Review core business logic
- Check configuration files
- Note any TODOs or FIXMEs
- Understand current architecture
- Compare implementation with design documents

**Expected Outcome**: Current implementation understood

### 5. Identify Documentation Drift

Compare documentation with actual implementation.

**Actions**:
- Check if design documents match implementation
- Note any undocumented features in code
- Identify outdated documentation
- Flag missing documentation
- List discrepancies

**Expected Outcome**: Documentation gaps identified

### 6. Update Stale Documentation

Refresh outdated documentation to match current state.

**Actions**:
- Update design documents if implementation differs
- Update task documents if steps have changed
- Add notes about discovered issues
- Update progress.yaml with current understanding
- Document any new patterns found in code

**Expected Outcome**: Documentation synchronized with code

### 7. Update Progress Tracking

Refresh progress.yaml with latest status.

**Actions**:
- Verify current milestone is correct
- Confirm current task is accurate
- Update progress percentages if needed
- Add recent work entry for initialization
- Update next steps based on current state
- Note any new blockers discovered

**Expected Outcome**: Progress tracking is current and accurate

### 8. Report Status and Next Steps

Provide comprehensive status report.

**Actions**:
- Summarize project status
- Show current milestone and progress
- Identify current task
- List recent accomplishments
- Highlight next steps
- Note any blockers or concerns
- Provide recommendations

**Expected Outcome**: User has complete context and knows what to do next

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting Fresh Session

**Context**: Beginning work on a project for the first time today

**Invocation**: `@acp-init`

**Result**: Checks for updates, reads all 15 agent files, reviews 10 source files, updates progress tracking, reports you're on milestone 2 task 5, ready to continue

### Example 2: Returning After Break

**Context**: Haven't worked on project in a week

**Invocation**: `@acp-init`

**Result**: Full context reload, discovers 3 new commits since last session, updates documentation to reflect changes, shows current status (milestone 3, 80% complete), identifies next task

### Example 3: New Agent Session

**Context**: Different AI agent picking up the project

**Invocation**: `@acp-init`

**Result**: Complete onboarding - reads all documentation, understands architecture from source code, gets current status, ready to contribute immediately

---

## Related Commands

- [`@acp-proceed`](acp.proceed.md) - Use after init to start working on current task
- [`@acp-status`](acp.status.md) - Use for quick status check without full initialization
- [`@acp-sync`](acp.sync.md) - Use to sync documentation after code changes
- [`@acp-version-check-for-updates`](acp.version-check-for-updates.md) - Part of init process

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No agent/ directory found

**Symptom**: Error message "agent/ directory not found"

**Cause**: ACP not installed in this project

**Solution**: Install ACP first using the installation script from the ACP repository

### Issue 2: Update check script not found

**Symptom**: Warning "check-for-updates.sh not found"

**Cause**: Older ACP installation without update scripts

**Solution**: This is non-critical, continue with initialization. Consider updating ACP to latest version.

### Issue 3: No source files found

**Symptom**: Warning "No source files to review"

**Cause**: Project is new or source code is in unexpected location

**Solution**: This is fine for new projects. Specify source file locations if they're in non-standard directories.

### Issue 4: progress.yaml doesn't exist

**Symptom**: Error "Cannot read progress.yaml"

**Cause**: Progress tracking not initialized yet

**Solution**: Create progress.yaml from template: `cp agent/progress.template.yaml agent/progress.yaml`, then run `@acp-init` again

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: All files in `agent/` directory, key source files throughout project, AGENT.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md
- **Writes**: `agent/progress.yaml` (updates status), design/task documents (if stale)
- **Executes**: `./agent/scripts/check-for-updates.sh` (if exists)

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None directly (update check script may access GitHub)
- **Repositories**: Update check script accesses GitHub repository

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Never reads .env files or credential files
- **Credentials**: Does not access any credentials

---

## Notes

- This is the most comprehensive ACP command - expect 30-60 seconds for large projects
- Reads many files to build complete context
- Updates documentation if drift is detected
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)
- Replaces the old "AGENT.md: Initialize" prompt
- Consider running at start of each session for best results
- Can be run mid-session if you need to refresh context
