## What This Command Does

This command displays the current version of ACP installed in the project by running a simple script that extracts version information from AGENT.md. It provides a quick way to check which version you're using without needing to manually open files.

Use this command when you need to verify your ACP version, check compatibility with other tools, or before reporting issues. It's a simple, read-only operation that provides version information at a glance.

Unlike `@acp-version-check-for-updates` which checks for newer versions, this command only shows your current version without making any network requests.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project (AGENT.md exists)
- [ ] `agent/scripts/version.sh` exists (or can extract from AGENT.md directly)

---

## Steps

### 1. Run Version Script

Execute the version check script.

**Actions**:
- Run `./agent/scripts/version.sh`
- Script extracts version from AGENT.md using grep
- Displays version, created date, and status

**Expected Outcome**: Version information displayed

**Alternative** (if script doesn't exist):
```bash
# Extract version directly from AGENT.md
grep -m 1 "^\*\*Version\*\*:" AGENT.md | sed 's/.*: //'
```

---

## Verification

- [ ] Version script executed successfully (or AGENT.md read directly)
- [ ] Version number displayed
- [ ] Output is clear and well-formatted
- [ ] No errors encountered
