**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-02-16

## What This Command Does

This command updates `agent/progress.yaml` with the latest project status. It's used after completing work to ensure progress tracking accurately reflects what's been accomplished. The command updates task statuses, milestone progress percentages, recent work entries, and next steps.

Use this command when you've completed tasks, made significant progress, or need to ensure the progress tracking is current. It's particularly useful after finishing a work session or when transitioning between tasks.

Unlike `@acp.sync` which updates documentation based on code changes, `@acp.update` focuses specifically on updating the progress tracking file to reflect completed work and current status.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: YAML syntax error after update

**Symptom**: progress.yaml has syntax errors

**Cause**: Incorrect indentation or formatting

**Solution**: Validate YAML syntax, fix indentation (use 2 spaces), ensure proper structure

### Issue 2: Progress percentages don't match

**Symptom**: Calculated percentage doesn't match tasks completed

**Cause**: Math error or incorrect task count

**Solution**: Recalculate: (tasks_completed / tasks_total) * 100, round to nearest integer

### Issue 3: Recent work entries out of order

**Symptom**: Dates not in chronological order

**Cause**: New entry added in wrong position

**Solution**: Ensure newest entries are first in the list, maintain reverse chronological order

- Use `@acp.sync` to update design docs and other documentation
- Progress percentages should be integers (0-100)
- Recent work entries should be concise but informative
- Keep next steps list focused (3-5 items maximum)
- Update frequently to maintain accurate tracking
- Can be run multiple times per day as needed
